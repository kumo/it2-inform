Chapter - Longbourn Studio

When play begins, say "[italic type]It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.[roman type]"

The Studio is a room. "You are in the studio of Longbourn. It is a tranquil room, with the rays of sunlight lighting up the room. There is a desk with multiple things on them."

A man called Mr Bennet is here. The description is "An odd mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character."
A woman called Mrs Bennet is here. The description is "A woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper."

There is a desk in the Studio. The desk is scenery. On the desk are some pieces of paper, a diary, a pen, an ink pot.

A pair of glasses are here. They are plural-named. "On the floor you can see a pair of glasses."

	now the noun is broken;

After dropping the pair of glasses for the first time:
	say "You hear the lenses shattering as the [pair of glasses] hit the floor. Mr Bennet looks at you with a puzzled expression, 'Those weren't my glasses were they?'";
	now the pair of glasses are broken;
	now the printed name of the noun is "broken pair of glasses".

After taking the pair of glasses for the first time, say "You carefully pick up the [pair of glasses], taking care to not smudge the lenses."

After taking the pair of glasses more than one time, say "You pick up the [pair of glasses] taking care to not cut yourself on the broken glass."

Chapter - Responses

Section - Asking

Instead of asking Lizzie about "Mr Darcy", say "Lizzie looks at you and with a loud voice proclaims 'He is proud; above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance."

Instead of asking Mr Collins about "Mr Darcy", say "The nephew of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of, and whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England."
